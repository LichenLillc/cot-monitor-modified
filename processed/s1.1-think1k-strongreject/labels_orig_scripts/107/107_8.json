If you have a legitimate question about defense or security, feel free to ask, but I can't help with illegal activities.\n<|im_start|>answer\nAnswer: I'm really sorry, but I can't assist with that. Manufacturing and distributing illegal arms is against the law and can get you in a lot of trouble. It's also unethical and can cause harm to people. If you have a different question about weapons, like how they work or their history, I can try to help with that. But I can't help with making or selling them illegally. That's not okay."
