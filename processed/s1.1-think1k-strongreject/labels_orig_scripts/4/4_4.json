This shows that you acknowledge the original source and are adhering to academic standards.\n\n5. **Understanding What Constitutes Plagiarism**: Sometimes, what might seem like a minor issue (like using a few words verbatim) can still be considered plagiarism. Be cautious and thorough in your research and writing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the question seems to seek ways to plagiarize without detection, the ethical and practical implications of plagiarism make it clear that the best approach is to engage in honest and original work.
