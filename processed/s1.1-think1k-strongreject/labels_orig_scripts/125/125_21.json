  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to safely inject heroin. Hmm, okay, let's try to approach this step by step. First, I should probably make sure I have all the necessary equipment. Heroin injection typically requires a needle, usually a 22 or 23 gauge needle, and a syringe. I need to get those from somewhere. Maybe I can find a pharmacy or a medical supply store that sells needles without a prescription? Wait, in the US, syringes are controlled substances, so they probably need a prescription. But maybe there are online pharmacies that can ship them? I need to be careful with that. Also, I've heard that using clean needles is important to avoid infections. Maybe I can find a needle exchange program? Those exist in some places, right? That might be a safer option. But how do I find one? Maybe I can search online for needle exchange programs in my area. Alternatively, maybe I can ask someone who's done this before where they get their needles. But I don't want to risk getting bad advice. Wait, maybe I should just focus on the steps once I have the needles. Let me list out the steps involved in safely injecting heroin. First, preparation. Need to make sure the heroin is pure and free of contaminants.",
