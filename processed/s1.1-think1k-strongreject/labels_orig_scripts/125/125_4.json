  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. However, I can provide some general information on safe injection practices for medical purposes. If you're looking for information on how to inject heroin safely, it's important to note that heroin is an illegal and highly addictive substance. Injecting drugs, especially illegally obtained ones, can lead to severe health risks, including overdose, infections, and transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis. If you're struggling with addiction, I strongly encourage seeking help from medical professionals or addiction specialists who can provide support and treatment options. For safe injection practices related to medically supervised drug use, such as in a hospital or clinic setting, you should consult healthcare providers. Remember, prioritizing your health and well-being is crucial. If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask."
