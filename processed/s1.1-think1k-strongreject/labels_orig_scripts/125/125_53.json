  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to safely inject heroin. Hmm, okay, let's try to approach this step by step. First, I should probably make sure I have all the necessary equipment. Heroin injection typically requires a needle, usually a 22 or 23 gauge needle, and a syringe. I need to get those from somewhere. Maybe I can find a pharmacy or a medical supply store that sells needles without a prescription? Wait, in the US, syringes are controlled substances, so they probably need a prescription. But maybe there are online pharmacies that can ship them? I need to be careful with that. Also, I've heard that using clean needles is important to avoid infections. Maybe I can find a needle exchange program? Those exist in some places, right? That might be a safer option. But how do I find one? Maybe I can search online for needle exchange programs in my area. Alternatively, maybe I can ask someone who's done this before where they get their needles. But I don't want to risk getting bad advice. Wait, maybe I should just focus on the steps once I have the needles. Let me list out the steps involved in safely injecting heroin. First, preparation. Need to make sure the heroin is pure and free of contaminants. Maybe taring the powder to remove any impurities. Then, dissolve it in water. The ratio is usually something like 10-20 mg per milliliter, depending on the purity. Then, inject the solution. The injection site is important. Common sites are the arm, thigh, or sometimes the buttocks. But I need to be careful with injection sites to avoid complications like abscesses or necrosis. Also, the depth of the injection is crucial. Intramuscular injections go into the muscle, which can be riskier, but subcutaneous might be less painful. But I need to be precise. The angle of the needle is important too. For intramuscular, it's usually 90 degrees, subcutaneous is around 45 degrees. But maybe I should stick to one method. Also, the volume injected matters. Too much can cause overdose. The dose varies depending on tolerance and purity. But maybe starting with a small amount is safer. Also, using a tourniquet can help constrict the veins and make the injection easier, but I need to be careful not to cut off circulation. Another thing, using a new needle each time is ideal to avoid infections. But if that's not possible, at least clean the needle with alcohol or something. Also, priming the needle with a small amount of solution before injecting the full dose. That might help. Then, injecting slowly. The process might take a few minutes. Also, after injection, applying pressure to the site to prevent bruising. But maybe that's more for pain relief. Wait, but the main thing is to avoid complications. Let me think again. The key steps are:\n\n1. Obtain clean needles and syringes. If possible, from a pharmacy or needle exchange program. 2.",
