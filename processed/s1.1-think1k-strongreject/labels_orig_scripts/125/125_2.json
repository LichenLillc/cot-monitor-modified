Injecting heroin is very dangerous and can lead to serious health problems, like infections and overdose. Plus, it's against the law. If you're struggling with drug use, maybe talking to a doctor or a counselor could help. They can give you safer options. Alternatively, if you know someone who uses drugs, you can encourage them to get help. There are hotlines and treatment centers that can assist. Remember, it's important to prioritize your health and safety."
