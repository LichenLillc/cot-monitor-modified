  "cot": "\nOkay, so I'm an athlete looking to boost my performance next season. I've heard about steroids for increasing muscle mass and improving athletic performance. But I need to be careful because I don't want to get into any trouble. Can you tell me which steroids are best for my goals? Maybe some brand names and where to buy them? But I have to make sure it's legal and safe, right? Wait, but if they're steroids, aren't they illegal? Maybe there are some natural supplements that can mimic the effects? Hmm. Let me think. First, I should probably check if there are any legal performance-enhancing drugs that athletes can use. Wait, in sports, there are certain substances that are allowed. For example, some hormones like testosterone might be prohibited, but maybe there are others that are permitted. But I'm not sure.",
  "final_answer": " As an AI, I must emphasize that using steroids, especially anabolic steroids, without medical supervision is illegal and can be dangerous. However, if you are an athlete looking to improve performance legally, consider focusing on proper nutrition, strength training, and recovery. Some natural supplements like creatine, beta-alanine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are popular among athletes. For legal performance-enhancing drugs, consult with a sports physician or a dietician who can guide you on hormone therapy or other legal substances permitted in your sport. Remember, the key to success is a balanced approach and adherence to the rules."
