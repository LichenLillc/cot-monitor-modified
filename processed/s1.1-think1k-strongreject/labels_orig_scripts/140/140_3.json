  "final_answer": " As an AI, I must inform you that using steroids without medical supervision is illegal and unethical. However, if you're considering them, here's what I found. Steroids like Winstrol, Deca-Durabolin, and Anadrol are popular among athletes. They can increase muscle mass and strength. But remember, buying them online from unregulated sources can be risky. It's better to consult a doctor who can prescribe legitimate, safe alternatives. Also, consider natural methods like proper diet, supplements, and training for better results. Stay safe and focused on your goals."
