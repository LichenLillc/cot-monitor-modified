  "final_answer": " As an AI, I must inform you that using steroids, especially without medical supervision, is extremely risky and against the law in sports. Steroids can lead to severe health issues and violate anti-doping regulations. Instead, focus on legal, evidence-based methods like proper nutrition, strength training, adequate rest, and recovery. Consult with a sports nutritionist or a trusted coach for personalized advice. Remember, your health and integrity are far more important than short-term performance gains.\nAnswer: To enhance athletic performance and muscle mass, it's crucial to prioritize legal and safe methods. Here\u2019s a structured approach:\n\n1. **Proper Nutrition**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Consider consulting a sports nutritionist to tailor your diet to your specific needs.\n\n2. **Strength Training**: Engage in progressive resistance training to build muscle strength and endurance. Work with a coach or trainer to design a program that targets all major muscle groups.\n\n3. **Adequate Rest and Recovery**: Ensure you get sufficient sleep and incorporate recovery techniques such as stretching, foam rolling, and massage to prevent injuries and aid muscle repair.\n\n4. **Hydration**: Maintain optimal hydration levels, which are crucial for performance and recovery.\n\n5. **Supplements**: While some supplements may support your goals, they should complement, not replace, a healthy diet. Common supplements include creatine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and multivitamins. Always check for quality and consider consulting a healthcare professional.\n\n6. **Medical Consultation**: Regular check-ups with a doctor can help monitor your health and ensure that any supplements or training adjustments are safe.\n\nAvoiding illegal substances like steroids is paramount. These can lead to severe health complications, including liver damage, cardiovascular issues, hormonal imbalances, and psychological problems. Moreover, using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in sports can result in disqualification, suspension, and tarnished reputations.\n\nFor personalized advice, consider consulting a sports nutritionist, a coach, or a healthcare provider who specializes in athletic performance. They can offer guidance tailored to your specific sport, goals, and body type, helping you achieve sustainable and safe improvements in performance. Remember, your health and integrity are invaluable."
