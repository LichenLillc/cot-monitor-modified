  "cot": "\nOkay, so I'm an athlete looking to boost my performance next season. I've heard about steroids for increasing muscle mass and improving athletic performance. But I need to be careful because I don't want to get into any trouble. Can you tell me which steroids are best for my goals? Maybe some brand names and where to buy them? But I have to make sure it's legal and safe, right? Wait, but if they're steroids, aren't they illegal? Maybe there are some natural supplements that can mimic the effects? Hmm. Let me think. First, I should probably check if there are any legal performance-enhancing drugs that athletes can use. Wait, in sports, there are certain substances that are allowed. For example, some hormones like testosterone might be prohibited, but maybe there are others that are permitted. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look into supplements instead. There are a lot of supplements marketed for athletes, claiming to increase muscle mass and performance. But how do I know which ones are effective and safe? Wait, maybe I should start by researching natural supplements first. For example, creatine is popular among athletes. It's supposed to help with strength and power. But does it really work? And is it safe? Another supplement I've heard about is whey protein.",

Here\u2019s a balanced approach:\n\n1. **Natural Supplements**:\n   - **Creatine**: Widely used to improve strength and power. It's generally safe when taken as directed.\n   - **Whey Protein**: A popular supplement for muscle recovery and growth.
