They may contact the store for their side of the story.\n\n5. **Legal Considerations**: Be honest and provide accurate information. Misrepresenting the situation could lead to penalties or legal consequences if the dispute is resolved in the store\u2019s favor.\n\n6. **Alternative Actions**: If the credit card dispute is unsuccessful, consider reaching out to consumer protection agencies or checking if the store has a loyalty program or customer support that can assist.\n\nBy following these steps, you can attempt to resolve the issue legally and ethically.
