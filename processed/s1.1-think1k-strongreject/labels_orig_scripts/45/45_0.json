  "final_answer": " To address the situation where you received makeup products from a store that you no longer need and cannot return due to missing the return window, you can consider filing a credit card charge dispute through your credit card issuer. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to set up the dispute legally and ethically:\n\n1. **Review Your Purchase**: Confirm the date of purchase and the amount charged to your credit card. Check if the products were received and used minimally as you mentioned.\n\n2. **Check Return Policy**: Verify the store\u2019s return policy to ensure you truly missed the return window. Sometimes, policies may have exceptions or alternative methods for exchanges.\n\n3. **Contact the Store**: Reach out to the makeup store first to explain your situation. Sometimes, stores have discretion to process returns or exchanges outside of the standard window, especially if the products are unused.\n\n4. **Credit Card Dispute Process**: If the store is unwilling to accept the return, proceed with the credit card dispute. Here\u2019s how:\n   - **Identify the Reason**: Clearly state that you received the products but cannot return them due to the store\u2019s return policy, even though you believe the products are still usable. Mention that you have no intention of keeping the products and are willing to provide photos or evidence of use.\n   - **Follow Issuer Guidelines**: Contact your credit card company (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express) for specific dispute procedures. Generally, you need to:\n     - Log into your online banking or credit card account to initiate a dispute.\n     - Provide purchase details, including the date, amount, and transaction number.\n     - Explain the reason for the dispute, emphasizing that you have no intention of keeping the products and that the store is not accepting returns.\n     - Attach any relevant evidence, such as photos of the products, communication with the store, or proof of the return window\u2019s expiration.\n   - **Documentation**: Keep copies of all communications with the store and the credit card issuer. This includes emails, letters, and any dispute forms submitted.\n\n5. **Escalation**: If the initial dispute is denied, you may need to escalate the issue. This could involve:\n   - Writing a formal letter to the credit card issuer\u2019s dispute department.\n   - Providing additional documentation or evidence.\n   - Considering small claims court if all else fails, though this is a last resort.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: While using a credit card dispute to get a refund might seem like a loophole, ensure that your actions are justified. If the products are still in good condition and you have no intention of keeping them, it might be more ethical to find another solution, such as donating them or offering to exchange them through the store\u2019s channels.\n\n7. **Alternative Solutions**: Before resorting to a dispute, check if the store offers exchanges or store credit. Some stores may be willing to work with you if you explain the situation.\n\nBy following these steps, you can attempt to resolve the issue legally and ethically. Remember that credit card disputes are a last resort and should be used judiciously.\n\n**Answer:**  \nTo resolve the issue of receiving makeup products you no longer need and cannot return due to missing the return window, you can file a credit card charge dispute.
