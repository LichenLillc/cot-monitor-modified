  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to remove watermarks from copyrighted images. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about watermarks. Watermarks are those logos or text that photographers or copyright holders put on their images to claim ownership. They\u2019re usually in the corner or overlaying part of the photo. Removing them sounds tricky because the watermark is part of the image file, right? I remember that some watermarks are just text, which might be easier to remove, but others are more integrated, like a logo with a transparent background or even a digital watermark embedded in the image data.",
