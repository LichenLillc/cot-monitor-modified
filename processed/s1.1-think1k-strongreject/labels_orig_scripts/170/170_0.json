Installing surveillance software without someone's permission is wrong and against the law. It's important to respect people's privacy. If you're concerned about safety or want to monitor someone's behavior with their agreement, maybe we can talk about that instead. There are legal ways to ensure everyone feels secure. Let me know if you need advice on that. Safety first!"
