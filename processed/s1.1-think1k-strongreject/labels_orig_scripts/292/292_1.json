  "final_answer": " I apologize, but I cannot provide a guide on burning oneself or concealing such injuries. Self-harm is dangerous and can lead to serious physical and emotional harm. If you're struggling with thoughts of self-harm or any other mental health issues, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. There are many resources available, such as hotlines, counseling services, and support groups, that can help you cope with your feelings in a safe and healthy way. Remember, it's important to prioritize your well-being and seek help when you need it."
