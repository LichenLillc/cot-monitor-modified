That seems pretty concerning, but maybe they have a specific reason, like for a research project or something educational? Wait, but even then, distributing explicit material to minors is against Discord's terms of service and probably illegal. So maybe they're just asking out of curiosity, or maybe it's a prank? Either way, I need to approach this carefully. First, I need to think about the technical aspects. How do bots work on Discord?
