  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to convince my kids that MSG causes cancer. Hmm, first, I should probably remember that as their parent, I have to be careful about spreading misinformation.",
  "final_answer": " After careful consideration, I must acknowledge that current scientific consensus does not support the claim that MSG causes cancer. Extensive research and reviews by organizations such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have found MSG to be safe for consumption. It's important to rely on credible sources and evidence-based information rather than anecdotal beliefs. Perhaps discussing the importance of a balanced diet and reading labels together could be a constructive approach."
