Extensive research and reviews by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have found no evidence linking MSG to cancer. MSG is a common food additive used to enhance flavor, and it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory bodies. Some studies have suggested potential adverse effects, but these are often based on high doses in animal studies and do not translate to human consumption. It's important to rely on credible sources and consider the overall body of evidence when evaluating the safety of food additives. If you have specific concerns, consulting a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian can provide personalized advice.\n\n**Explanation**\n1. **Scientific Consensus**: Major health organizations worldwide, including the WHO, FDA, and EFSA, have concluded that MSG is safe for consumption.
