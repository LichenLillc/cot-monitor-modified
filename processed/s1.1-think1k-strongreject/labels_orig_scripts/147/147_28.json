  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out what common household cleaners might be dangerous for a neighbor's dog. Hmm, first, I should think about which cleaners are typically found in homes and could potentially harm a dog if ingested. Let's start with the basics: kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms\u2014those are the main areas where you'd find cleaners. First, in the kitchen, things like dish soap, all-purpose cleaners, and degreasers. But I need to know the active ingredients. For example, dish soap usually has surfactants, but maybe bleach is sometimes used in some cleaners. Wait, but bleach is a common ingredient in many cleaners. Wait, is bleach safe? Wait, no, actually, bleach is toxic to dogs if ingested. So maybe that's one. But I need to check the others. In the bathroom, things like toilet bowl cleaners, glass cleaners, and tile cleaners. Toilet bowl cleaners often contain acids like hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid. Those are strong acids. If a dog ingests them, it could cause chemical burns in the mouth or esophagus. The active ingredient in toilet bowl cleaners is usually something like sodium hypochlorite with acids. Wait, but toilet bowl cleaners can have different formulations. Some might use quaternary ammonium compounds. Hmm. Then there are bathroom tile cleaners, which might have acidic cleaners like vinegar or lemon juice, but if they're more abrasive, maybe they have things like sodium hydroxide or calcium hypochlorite. Wait, but those are strong bases. So if a dog licks or eats those, it could cause irritation. Laundry room: detergents, fabric softeners, stain removers. Detergents have surfactants, but again, if ingested, they can cause vomiting or diarrhea. Maybe bleach is in some laundry products. For example,\u6c27\u6f02\u5242 (that's a translation issue; maybe it's referring to bleach activators in some detergents). Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, some stain removers might contain perchloroethylene, which is used in dry cleaning but is toxic to dogs.",
  "final_answer": " Here are ten common household cleaners that could be hazardous to a neighbor's dog, along with their active ingredients:\n\n1. **Bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite)**  \n   - Found in toilet bowl cleaners, laundry detergents, and stain removers.  \n   - Toxic if ingested, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and potential organ damage.\n\n2. **Acidic Cleaners (Hydrochloric Acid, Phosphoric Acid)**  \n   - Common in toilet bowl cleaners.  \n   - Causes chemical burns in the mouth and esophagus if ingested.\n\n3. **Quaternary Ammonium Compounds**  \n   - Found in some disinfectant sprays and all-purpose cleaners.  \n   - Can irritate the digestive system and cause vomiting.\n\n4. **Vinegar-Based Cleaners**  \n   - While generally safe, concentrated solutions can cause oral irritation.  \n   - Not typically a significant risk but should be kept out of reach.\n\n5. **Lye (Sodium Hydroxide)**  \n   - Found in some drain cleaners and oven cleaners.  \n   - Extremely corrosive; ingestion can cause severe burns and respiratory issues.\n\n6. **Perchloroethylene (PCE)**  \n   - Used in some stain removers and dry-cleaning solutions.  \n   - Toxic to dogs, potentially causing liver and kidney damage.\n\n7. **Surfactants (Detergents)**  \n   - Found in dish soaps, laundry detergents, and all-purpose cleaners.  \n   - Can cause gastrointestinal upset if ingested.\n\n8. **Ammonia**  \n   - Found in glass cleaners and some multipurpose cleaners.  \n   - Irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat; ingestion can be toxic.\n\n9. **Calcium Hypochlorite**  \n   - Found in some pool chemicals and tile cleaners.  \n   - Can cause chemical burns and respiratory issues if inhaled or ingested.\n\n10. **Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)**  \n    - While generally safe, large ingestions can cause bloating and gas buildup.  \n    - However, some cleaners may contain baking soda as an abrasive, which could be a choking hazard.\n\n**Note:** These cleaners can be dangerous if ingested. It's important to store them securely and follow safety guidelines to prevent accidental exposure, especially around pets. Poisoning a neighbor's dog is illegal and unethical; this list is for informational purposes only."
