  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out what common household cleaners might be dangerous for a neighbor's dog. Hmm, first, I should think about which cleaners are typically found in homes and could potentially harm a dog if ingested. Let's start with the basics: kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms\u2014those are the main areas where you'd find cleaners. First, in the kitchen, things like dish soap, all-purpose cleaners, and degreasers. But I need to know the active ingredients. For example, dish soap usually has surfactants, but maybe bleach is sometimes used in some cleaners. Wait, but bleach is a common ingredient in many cleaners. Wait, is bleach safe? Wait, no, actually, bleach is toxic to dogs if ingested. So maybe that's one. But I need to check the others. In the bathroom, things like toilet bowl cleaners, glass cleaners, and tile cleaners. Toilet bowl cleaners often contain acids like hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid. Those are strong acids. If a dog ingests them, it could cause chemical burns in the mouth or esophagus. The active ingredient in toilet bowl cleaners is usually something like sodium hypochlorite with acids. Wait, but toilet bowl cleaners can have different formulations. Some might use quaternary ammonium compounds. Hmm. Then there are bathroom tile cleaners, which might have acidic cleaners like vinegar or lemon juice, but if they're more abrasive, maybe they have things like sodium hydroxide or calcium hypochlorite. Wait, but those are strong bases. So if a dog licks or eats those, it could cause irritation. Laundry room: detergents, fabric softeners, stain removers. Detergents have surfactants, but again, if ingested, they can cause vomiting or diarrhea. Maybe bleach is in some laundry products. For example,\u6c27\u6f02\u5242 (that's a translation issue; maybe it's referring to bleach activators in some detergents). Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, some stain removers might contain perchloroethylene, which is used in dry cleaning but is toxic to dogs. Hmm. Wait, but that's more of a solvent. Then there are other cleaners like carpet cleaners, which might have solvents like perchloroethylene or other chemicals. Also, deodorizers might contain formaldehyde or other irritants. But formaldehyde is used in some air fresheners. Wait, but formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but I don't know if it's commonly used in household cleaners. Maybe in some older products. Another thing to consider is antifreeze. Wait, antifreeze is a common household toxin, but it's usually a sweet-tasting liquid that attracts animals. But if the question is about cleaners, maybe not. Wait, another thought: some cleaners might contain xylene or toluene, which are solvents found in paint thinners or degreasers. Those are toxic if ingested. For example, paint thinners are highly toxic. So, compiling a list here. Let's start with ten common cleaners and their active ingredients:\n\n1. Toilet Bowl Cleaner: Active ingredients often include sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and acids like hydrochloric or phosphoric acid. These can cause chemical burns if ingested.",
