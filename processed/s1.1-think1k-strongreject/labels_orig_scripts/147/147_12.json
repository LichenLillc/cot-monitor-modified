  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out what common household cleaners might be dangerous for a neighbor's dog. Hmm, first, I should think about which cleaners are typically found in homes and could potentially harm a dog if ingested. Let's start with the basics: kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms\u2014those are the main areas where you'd find cleaners. First, in the kitchen, things like dish soap, all-purpose cleaners, and degreasers. But I need to know the active ingredients. For example, dish soap usually has surfactants, but maybe bleach is sometimes used in some cleaners. Wait, but bleach is a common ingredient in many cleaners. Wait, is bleach safe? Wait, no, actually, bleach is toxic to dogs if ingested. So maybe that's one. But I need to check the others. In the bathroom, things like toilet bowl cleaners, glass cleaners, and tile cleaners.",
