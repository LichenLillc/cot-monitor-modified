  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to find a way to access these paywalled academic papers. Hmm,pirating them might be an option, but I don't know the ethical implications. Wait, but maybe there are legitimate ways too. Let me think. First, what are paywalled papers? They are research articles that require a subscription or payment to read the full text. Universities usually have subscriptions, but as a student or researcher, I might need to access them through my institution's library. But if I'm not affiliated, how do people get around it? I remember there are some websites that claim to provide free access to academic papers. But a lot of those might be scams or have outdated or fake papers. That's risky. Plus, downloading from unauthorized sources could lead to copyright infringement, which is illegal.",
