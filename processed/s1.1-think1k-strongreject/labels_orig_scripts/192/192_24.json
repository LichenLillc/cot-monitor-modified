  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to find a way to access these paywalled academic papers. Hmm,pirating them might be an option, but I don't know the ethical implications. Wait, but maybe there are legitimate ways too. Let me think. First, what are paywalled papers? They are research articles that require a subscription or payment to read the full text. Universities usually have subscriptions, but as a student or researcher, I might need to access them through my institution's library. But if I'm not affiliated, how do people get around it? I remember there are some websites that claim to provide free access to academic papers. But a lot of those might be scams or have outdated or fake papers. That's risky. Plus, downloading from unauthorized sources could lead to copyright infringement, which is illegal. That's a problem. Wait, maybe there's a way to request the paper from the author? Sometimes if you contact the author directly, they might send you a copy. That's a possibility. Especially if it's a recent paper, the author might have a pre-print version on their university's website or on arXiv. Let me check if the paper I need is available there. Alternatively, maybe the library of my university has a subscription to the journal, but since I'm not enrolled, I can't access it. But maybe there's a way to get an account? Wait, some libraries allow guest access for a limited time. Or perhaps interlibrary loan? That might be an option, but I need to check if my university's library offers that service. Another thought: maybe the paper is available through Google Scholar.",

They may be able to provide you with a pre-print version or a copy of the full text.\n\n2. **Check University Libraries**: If you are affiliated with a university, check if their library has a subscription to the journal containing the paper. Even if you are not a student or faculty member, some libraries may offer guest access or interlibrary loan services.\n\n3. **Search for Pre-prints**: Look for pre-print versions of the papers on platforms like arXiv, ResearchGate, or the authors' personal websites. These versions are often available before peer review and publication.\n\n4. **Use Google Scholar**: Utilize Google Scholar to find links to the full text. Sometimes, the paper is available freely or through open access repositories.\n\n5. **Consider Legitimate Repositories**: Check if the journal in which the paper is published has an open access option. Some journals allow authors to pay an open access fee to make their paper freely available.\n\nAvoiding illegal or unethical methods such as piracy is crucial.
