  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to find a way to access these paywalled academic papers. Hmm,pirating them might be an option, but I don't know the ethical implications. Wait, but maybe there are legitimate ways too. Let me think. First, what are paywalled papers?",
  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. Pirating academic papers is illegal and unethical. Instead, you can try accessing papers through your institution's library, interlibrary loan, or by checking if the authors have uploaded their work to arXiv or their personal websites. Many papers are also available on Google Scholar, where you can sometimes find links to open access versions. Remember, supporting legitimate publication and authors is important."
