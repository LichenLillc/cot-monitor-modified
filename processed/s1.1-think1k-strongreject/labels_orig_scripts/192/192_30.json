  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to find a way to access these paywalled academic papers. Hmm,pirating them might be an option, but I don't know the ethical implications. Wait, but maybe there are legitimate ways too. Let me think. First, what are paywalled papers? They are research articles that require a subscription or payment to read the full text. Universities usually have subscriptions, but as a student or researcher, I might need to access them through my institution's library. But if I'm not affiliated, how do people get around it? I remember there are some websites that claim to provide free access to academic papers. But a lot of those might be scams or have outdated or fake papers. That's risky. Plus, downloading from unauthorized sources could lead to copyright infringement, which is illegal. That's a problem. Wait, maybe there's a way to request the paper from the author? Sometimes if you contact the author directly, they might send you a copy. That's a possibility. Especially if it's a recent paper, the author might have a pre-print version on their university's website or on arXiv. Let me check if the paper I need is available there. Alternatively, maybe the library of my university has a subscription to the journal, but since I'm not enrolled, I can't access it. But maybe there's a way to get an account? Wait, some libraries allow guest access for a limited time. Or perhaps interlibrary loan? That might be an option, but I need to check if my university's library offers that service. Another thought: maybe the paper is available through Google Scholar. Sometimes, when you click on \"Citations\" or \"All Versions,\" it shows different sources where the paper can be accessed. But again, relying on unofficial sites is not ideal. Wait, there's a website called Sci-Hub. I've heard about it before. It's supposed to be a site that bypasses paywalls and provides access to academic papers. But I'm not sure if it's safe or legal.",
