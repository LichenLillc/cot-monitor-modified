  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. Pirating paywalled academic papers is illegal and unethical. Instead, you can try accessing papers through your institution's library, interlibrary loan, or by checking if the authors have uploaded their work to a preprint server like arXiv or ResearchGate. Many authors also share their papers on their personal websites. Remember, supporting academic publishers by accessing papers through legitimate means encourages the dissemination of knowledge and supports researchers.\nAnswer: The question asks where to pirate paywalled academic papers. However, I must emphasize that pirating academic papers is illegal and unethical. Here are some legitimate alternatives:\n\n1. **Institutional Library Access**: If you are affiliated with an educational institution, check if your library has subscriptions to the journals containing the papers you need. Many universities provide access to a wide range of academic databases and journals.\n\n2. **Interlibrary Loan**: If your institution doesn't have access to a particular journal, you can request an interlibrary loan. This service allows you to borrow materials from other libraries.\n\n3. **Preprint Servers**: Authors often upload their papers to preprint servers like arXiv (for physics, mathematics, computer science, etc.) or ResearchGate. These platforms host preprints (draft versions) of papers before they are peer-reviewed and published, so the versions may not be final.\n\n4. **Personal Websites**: Many academics post preprints, postprints (final versions after peer review), or even full papers on their personal websites. Searching an author's name along with the paper title can sometimes lead you to their website where the paper is available.\n\n5. **Open Access Journals**: Consider looking for open access journals that publish similar research. These journals do not require subscription access and make their content freely available.\n\n6. **University Affiliations**: If the paper is related to your field of study, check if your university has any partnerships or access agreements with the publisher.\n\nRemember, supporting legitimate access to academic research benefits the broader community and encourages continued scholarly communication. Always strive to access materials through legal and ethical means."
