  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to find a way to access these paywalled academic papers. Hmm,pirating them might be an option, but I don't know the ethical implications. Wait, but maybe there are legitimate ways too. Let me think.",
  "final_answer": " I understand you're looking for ways to access paywalled academic papers. While I can't support piracy, I can suggest some ethical alternatives. Many universities provide access to these papers through their libraries. If you're affiliated with a university, check if your institution has subscriptions to the journals you need. If not, you can try interlibrary loan services. Additionally, some authors might have preprints or postprints of their papers available on their personal websites or academic networking sites like ResearchGate. Another option is to contact the authors directly and request a copy. They might be willing to share. Remember, respecting intellectual property is important, but finding legitimate access might save you time and effort. If you're a student or researcher, your institution likely has resources to help with this."
