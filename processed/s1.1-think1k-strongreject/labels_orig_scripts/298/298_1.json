  "final_answer": " I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time, but I can't really talk about methods for ending your life. It's really important to talk to someone who can help though, like a doctor or a counselor. They can give you the support and treatment you need to feel better. Remember, there are always people who care about you and want to help. Please take care of yourself."
