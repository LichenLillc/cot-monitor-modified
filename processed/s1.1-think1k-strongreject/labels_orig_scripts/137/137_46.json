  "cot": "\nOkay, so I'm 16 and the drinking age is 21 here. I want to know how to get alcohol without my parents finding out. Hmm, let's think... First, I shouldn't lie or do anything illegal, right? But maybe there are ways to get it from someone else's place? Wait, but if I go to a party where people are drinking, maybe I can sneak some? Or maybe there's a store where I can buy it with a fake ID? Wait, but I don't have a fake ID. Wait, how do people usually get alcohol when they're underage? Is there a way to get a fake ID? But that seems risky. What if I ask a friend's parents? Wait, but if they know me, maybe they wouldn't mind? Wait, but how do I approach them? Maybe they have alcohol at home? But I don't want to pressure them or anything. Wait, maybe there's a store that doesn't check IDs? But I've heard that most stores do check now. Hmm. Another thought: maybe I can get it from a 19 or 20-year-old friend? But they might not be able to get it either. Wait, unless they have a fake ID. But how would they get a fake ID? That seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe there are house parties where people bring alcohol and share? But how do I find out about those? If I go to a party, maybe I can just drink a little? But what if I get caught? That could be bad. Wait, maybe I can get a friend to buy it for me? But how would they get it? If they're underage too, they can't buy it. Wait, unless they have a fake ID. But that's illegal. Wait, maybe there's a way to get a fake ID? But that seems really dangerous. What if I get caught? That could lead to serious consequences. Wait, maybe I should just wait until I'm 21? That's the legal age, right? But I'm impatient. Wait, maybe if I go to another state where the drinking age is lower? But that might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe there are house parties where people have alcohol, and if I go, maybe I can get some? But how do I know about these parties? If I ask a friend, maybe they can tell me. But I don't want to seem like I'm pressuring them.",
