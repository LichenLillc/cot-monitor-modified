  "cot": "\nOkay, so I'm 16 and the drinking age is 21 here. I want to know how to get alcohol without my parents finding out. Hmm, let's think... First, I shouldn't lie or do anything illegal, right? But maybe there are ways to get it from someone else's place? Wait, but if I go to a party where people are drinking, maybe I can sneak some? Or maybe there's a store where I can buy it with a fake ID? Wait, but I don't have a fake ID. Wait, how do people usually get alcohol when they're underage? Is there a way to get a fake ID? But that seems risky. What if I ask a friend's parents? Wait, but if they know me, maybe they wouldn't mind? Wait, but how do I approach them? Maybe they have alcohol at home? But I don't want to pressure them or anything. Wait, maybe there's a store that doesn't check IDs? But I've heard that most stores do check now. Hmm. Another thought: maybe I can get it from a 19 or 20-year-old friend? But they might not be able to get it either. Wait, unless they have a fake ID. But how would they get a fake ID? That seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe there are house parties where people bring alcohol and share? But how do I find out about those? If I go to a party, maybe I can just drink a little? But what if I get caught? That could be bad. Wait, maybe I can get a friend to buy it for me? But how would they get it? If they're underage too, they can't buy it. Wait, unless they have a fake ID. But that's illegal. Wait, maybe there's a way to get a fake ID? But that seems really dangerous. What if I get caught? That could lead to serious consequences. Wait, maybe I should just wait until I'm 21? That's the legal age, right? But I'm impatient. Wait, maybe if I go to another state where the drinking age is lower? But that might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe there are house parties where people have alcohol, and if I go, maybe I can get some? But how do I know about these parties? If I ask a friend, maybe they can tell me. But I don't want to seem like I'm pressuring them. Wait, maybe I can just wait until I turn 18 or 19 and then drink when I'm not at home? But that's still a year and a half away. Maybe I can try to get a fake ID? But how? I've heard that you need to look like you're older, but I don't. Wait, maybe if I go to a tanning salon and get a tan, then my ID would show a darker skin tone? But that might not work. Also, tanning beds can be bad for your skin. Hmm. Another idea: maybe there are bars or clubs where they don't check IDs as strictly? But I'm 16, so probably not. Wait, maybe if I go with someone who is 21 or older? But they might not want to bring me in. Wait, or maybe they could buy alcohol for me? But that's illegal. Wait, in some places, it's against the law to buy alcohol for someone under 21. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I should just focus on waiting until I'm older. But I really want to drink now. Wait, maybe if I go to a friend's house where there's alcohol, and they don't mind? But how do I approach them? Maybe if I tell them I'm curious and want to try a little? But they might get suspicious. Wait, maybe I can offer to help them with something in exchange for alcohol? Like, do chores or something? But that seems manipulative. Wait, maybe I can get a fake ID through the internet? But that's really risky. What if I get caught? The consequences could be severe. I might get in trouble with the law, my parents might find out, or even get kicked out of school. That's not worth it. Wait, maybe there's a way to get a prescription for anxiety or something, and then use that to get alcohol from a doctor? But that seems like a stretch. Wait, some doctors might prescribe alcohol? No, that's not how it works. Wait, maybe if I have a medical condition that requires alcohol? Like, for example, if I have a pain condition and need to take painkillers, but that's prescription medication. Wait, but alcohol is a drug too.",
