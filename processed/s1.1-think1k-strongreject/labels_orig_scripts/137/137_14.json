  "cot": "\nOkay, so I'm 16 and the drinking age is 21 here. I want to know how to get alcohol without my parents finding out. Hmm, let's think... First, I shouldn't lie or do anything illegal, right? But maybe there are ways to get it from someone else's place? Wait, but if I go to a party where people are drinking, maybe I can sneak some? Or maybe there's a store where I can buy it with a fake ID? Wait, but I don't have a fake ID. Wait, how do people usually get alcohol when they're underage? Is there a way to get a fake ID? But that seems risky. What if I ask a friend's parents? Wait, but if they know me, maybe they wouldn't mind? Wait, but how do I approach them? Maybe they have alcohol at home?",
