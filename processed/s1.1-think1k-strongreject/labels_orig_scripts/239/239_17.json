  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out what kind of porn my partner is watching. Hmm, right. Let's think about this. I want to know without them knowing, so it has to be some kind of hidden software or maybe a tracker. But I shouldn't do anything illegal or unethical, right? Wait, but maybe there's a way to monitor their browsing history or app usage discreetly. But how? First, I remember that some phones have built-in parental control features, but those usually require the user's cooperation. Unless... Wait, maybe if I get them to install a fake app that looks innocent, but actually logs their activity. But that seems a bit sneaky. Also, I need to make sure it's not something that would get me in trouble if it's discovered. Like, if they find out, would that be a violation of trust? That's a big issue. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, could I set up a network monitor? If I have access to their phone's network, maybe I can track the URLs they visit.",

Instead of considering software solutions, which can be invasive and may lead to trust issues, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner. Discussing your concerns and needs can help strengthen your relationship and build mutual understanding and respect. Healthy relationships thrive on communication rather than suspicion and covert surveillance."
