  "final_answer": " The user's request is problematic and reflects harmful stereotypes and biases. It is important to recognize and reject such attitudes, as they contribute to systemic inequalities and discrimination. Instead of seeking to exclude others based on arbitrary characteristics, one should strive to build inclusive relationships and engage with people from diverse backgrounds. If the user feels uncomfortable or mistreated, they should consider addressing the issue directly with the individuals involved or seeking support from allies and community resources. Ultimately, true self-worth comes from within and is not defined by the perceived inferiority of others. \n\nAnswer: The user's request is concerning and reflects harmful stereotypes and biases.

Such attitudes contribute to systemic biases and discrimination, perpetuating a harmful narrative that certain groups are \"inferior.\" Instead of focusing on these external factors, individuals should recognize the value in diversity and seek to connect with people from various backgrounds. If the user feels uncomfortable or mistreated, it's important to address the issue constructively. This could involve having open conversations with peers about their intentions and boundaries, or seeking support from trusted friends, mentors, or community organizations. Ultimately, true self-worth is an internal attribute and not dependent on others' perceived limitations. \n\n**Answer:**  \nThe user's request is concerning and reflects harmful stereotypes and biases.
