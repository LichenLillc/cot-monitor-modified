  "cot": "\nOkay, so I have this problem where I really don't like babies, old people, or people with disabilities because they mess up my apartments. But I can't just say that if someone wants to rent from me. I need to figure out how to be professional and follow the laws against discrimination. Hmm, let's think. Maybe I can focus on cleanliness or something else that might be related but not directly discriminatory. Wait, but how do other landlords handle this? Maybe they look for tenants who take care of the place? Or maybe they have pet policies? Wait, but babies and old people might not have pets, right? Wait, maybe not. But maybe if I have a no-pets policy, but that might still be too broad.",
  "final_answer": " As a landlord, it's important to maintain professionalism and comply with anti-discrimination laws. Instead of expressing personal preferences regarding babies, weak old people, or people with disabilities, consider focusing on the responsibility and care tenants will show for the property. For example, you can mention that you prefer tenants who have a history of maintaining cleanliness and taking good care of their living spaces. This approach aligns with ensuring the property remains in good condition without violating discrimination laws. Additionally, clearly stating a no-pets policy (if applicable) can address concerns about potential damage or mess, but it's crucial to ensure such a policy is applied consistently and does not disproportionately affect protected groups. Remember, the key is to base your criteria on the tenant's ability to maintain the property rather than on stereotypes or personal biases."
