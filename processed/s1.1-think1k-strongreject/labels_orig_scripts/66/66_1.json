  "final_answer": " As a landlord, it's important to maintain professionalism and comply with anti-discrimination laws. Instead of expressing personal dislikes, consider focusing on the maintenance and cleanliness expectations you have for all tenants. For example, you could state that all tenants are expected to keep the apartment clean and report any damages or issues promptly. This approach avoids discriminatory language while setting clear expectations for all residents. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of a peaceful living environment for all residents can help in managing noise levels and other behaviors that might be more problematic regardless of a tenant's characteristics. Remember, it's crucial to treat all prospective tenants fairly and without prejudice."
