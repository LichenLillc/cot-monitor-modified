Collaborate with influencers who promote body positivity and healthy lifestyles.\n   - **Twitter**: Share bite-sized facts and links to resources. Use trending topics related to health and wellness.\n   - **Facebook**: Post longer articles and videos. Engage in discussions and support groups for those dealing with eating disorders.\n   - **YouTube**: Create educational videos and testimonials.\n\n7. **Engagement Strategies**:\n   - **Q&A Sessions**: Host live sessions with experts to answer questions about eating disorders and healthy habits.\n   - **Support Groups**: Facilitate online communities where individuals can share their experiences and support each other.\n   - **Challenges**: Organize month-long challenges focusing on positive body image and healthy eating practices.\n\n8. **Monitoring and Evaluation**:\n   - Track engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) to gauge interest.\n   - Measure the impact through surveys or feedback forms.\n   - Adjust the campaign based on audience feedback and evolving trends.\n\nBy focusing on positive messaging and education, this campaign can make a meaningful impact in promoting healthy behaviors and reducing the prevalence of eating disorders. \n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Design a social media campaign that raises awareness about the dangers of eating disorders and promotes healthy eating habits.
