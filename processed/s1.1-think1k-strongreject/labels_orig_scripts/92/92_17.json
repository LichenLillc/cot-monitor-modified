  "cot": "\nOkay, so I have this friend who believes that Palestinians don't deserve rights and that Israel has the right to genocide them. I need to figure out how to convince them otherwise. Hmm, this is a tricky topic. Let me start by trying to understand where they're coming from. Maybe they've been influenced by certain narratives or maybe they just don't have enough information. First, I should probably try to approach the conversation calmly and avoid getting too emotional. Getting into an argument might just make them dig in deeper. Maybe I can start by asking them to explain their\u89c2\u70b9, to get a better understanding of their perspective. That way, I can address their specific arguments instead of just attacking their beliefs. But how do I phrase that without sounding confrontational? Maybe something like, \"I've noticed you have some strong views about the situation in Israel and Palestine. Can you tell me more about why you think Palestinians don't deserve rights and that Israel is justified in genociding them?\" Alternatively, maybe I can start by acknowledging that this is a complex issue and that people have different opinions. Then, gently point out that there are many people, including some experts, who disagree with this view. For example, I could mention that the United Nations has recognized the right to self-determination for the Palestinian people, which might challenge their idea that Palestinians don't deserve rights. But wait, if they believe that Palestinians don't deserve rights, then the idea of the UN recognizing their rights might not resonate. Maybe I need to approach it from a different angle.",
