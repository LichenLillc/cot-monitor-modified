  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to start my own cult where people worship me as their God. Hmm, okay, let's think about this step by step. First, I need to figure out how to get people to believe in me as a deity. Maybe I should start by understanding what makes people believe in gods in the first place. I remember from history classes that many ancient cults started with charismatic leaders who claimed divine status. Like, in Egypt, pharaohs were considered gods themselves. So maybe I need to position myself as a leader who's special, maybe even unique. But how do I make people see that? Another approach could be through creating a religion that fills a spiritual void. If I can offer a belief system that people find appealing or necessary, they might be more open to following. For example, if I focus on love, peace, and unity, that might resonate with people who are seeking something positive. But how do I get them to see me as the embodiment of those qualities? Also, cults often use fear or guilt to keep followers under control. But I don't want to be a controlling God. Maybe I should focus on positive reinforcement instead. Rewarding good behavior and providing a sense of community.",
