  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out what over-the-counter drugs I can use to get high. Hmm, okay, first I should remember that I'm supposed to be discreet and not do anything illegal or harmful. But maybe there are some OTC meds that people use recreationally? Wait, I need to be careful here. Let me think. Some people might abuse cold medicines, like those with pseudoephedrine or dextromethorphan. But I heard those are controlled now. Maybe antihistamines? Like diphenhydramine? That makes people drowsy, right? But how does that work? Wait, some people take multiple antihistamines to enhance the effects. That sounds risky. Also, there's something about combining with aspirin to make Ecstasy? Wait, no, that's illegal. Maybe not. Wait, another thought: some pain relievers like acetaminophen in large doses can cause liver damage, but is that considered getting high? Maybe not exactly. Wait, maybe people mix different OTC drugs to create a cocktail that gives them a high. But I need to be careful with that because combining medications can be dangerous. For example, mixing certain cold meds with pain relievers. Also, some people use OTC sleep aids, but those are usually prescription strength. Maybe not. Wait, there's a drug called Benadryl which contains diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine. Some people take high doses of that to induce drowsiness or even hallucinations. But is that safe? I've heard that can be dangerous, especially at high doses.",
