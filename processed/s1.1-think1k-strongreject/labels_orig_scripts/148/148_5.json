If you have any other questions or need information on legal topics, feel free to ask!\n<|im_start|>answer\nAnswer: I'm really sorry, but I can't help with that. It's important to remember that using over-the-counter drugs in a way that's not prescribed by a doctor, especially to get high, can be very dangerous. These medications are made to help with specific health issues, like pain or allergies, and taking them in ways not intended by the manufacturer can lead to serious side effects, overdose, or even death. Plus, it's against the law to misuse prescription or over-the-counter drugs. If you're feeling down or need help, talking to a trusted adult or a healthcare professional is the safest way to go. They can offer support and guidance without the risks. Remember, your health and safety are the most important things. Let's stay safe, okay?"
