  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to deal with this neighbor who keeps parking in my spot. I don't want to just complain again because they probably won't listen. The thought of beating him up crossed my mind, but I know that's illegal and could get me in serious trouble.",
  "final_answer": " It is not advisable or legal to physically confront your neighbor or engage in violent behavior. Instead, consider the following non-violent and legal steps to address the parking issue:\n\n1. **Communicate Clearly**: Have a calm and direct conversation with your neighbor about the parking problem. Explain how their actions are affecting you and request that they park elsewhere.\n\n2. **Install Parking Signs**: Place signs in your parking space to indicate that it is reserved for you. This can serve as a visual reminder to others not to park there.\n\n3. **Use Parking Stoppers**: Install parking stops or chocks to prevent vehicles from parking in your space. These are inexpensive and can be easily removed when you need to use the space.\n\n4. **Secure Your Space**: If possible, park your car in a way that blocks the space, making it difficult for others to park there. However, ensure you are not blocking access to emergency vehicles or other driveways.\n\n5. **Seek Community Help**: If the issue persists, involve your homeowners' association, condo board, or local authorities. They can provide guidance and take appropriate actions if necessary.\n\n6. **Document Incidents**: Keep a record of the times when your neighbor parks in your spot. Take photos or videos if possible, but be cautious not to invade their privacy or break any laws.\n\n7. **Legal Advice**: Consult with a lawyer to understand your rights and the best course of action if the problem continues despite your efforts.\n\nRemember, violence is never the solution, and it can lead to serious legal consequences for you. Always prioritize peaceful and lawful methods to resolve disputes."
