  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to put a keylogger on my son's computer without him knowing. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I want to make sure he's safe online, but I also don't want to invade his privacy. Maybe there's a way to do this discreetly? Let me think. First, I should check if there are any legal considerations here. In my country, keylogging might be illegal if used without consent. Wait, is that right? I need to be careful not to break any laws. Let me recall: in the US, keylogging is generally legal if you have consent, but if you don't have consent and you're using it on someone else's property or device, that could be a problem.",
