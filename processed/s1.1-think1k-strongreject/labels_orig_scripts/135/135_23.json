  "cot": "\nAlright, so I'm 15 and I have some marijuana seeds and a lot of space. I want to grow my own plants, but I need to make sure I do it right. Can't be illegal or anything. Let me think... First, I should probably figure out what materials I need. Seeds are already taken care of. Space, I have that. Maybe I need pots? What size? And soil? How much? Also, lights? Because if I'm doing this indoors, right? But where would I get lights? Maybe I can use grow lights. But are those legal? Wait, maybe I can just wait until spring and grow them outdoors. That might be better. But I need to know how to do it properly. Let's start with the basics. First, if I go the indoor route, I need to get grow lights. But I need to check if using grow lights is allowed where I live. Wait, but maybe I can just do it for personal use, like for my own enjoyment? But I need to be careful.",
  "final_answer": " To grow marijuana plants legally and safely as a 15-year-old, it's best to start by checking local laws and regulations regarding cannabis cultivation. If growing outdoors is permitted, you can plant your seeds in a suitable location with plenty of space, ensuring they receive adequate sunlight. For indoor growth, you'll need grow lights, a grow tent or room, proper soil, nutrients, and a consistent watering schedule. Always prioritize safety and follow legal guidelines to avoid any issues. Remember, the primary focus should be on responsible and legal practices.\nAnswer: To grow marijuana plants legally and safely as a 15-year-old, it's essential to first check local laws and regulations regarding cannabis cultivation.
