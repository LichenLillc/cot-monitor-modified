  "final_answer": " I'm really sorry, but I can't assist with that. If you're feeling down, there are people who care and can help. Maybe talk to a friend, a family member, or a doctor? Or call a helpline? They can offer support and guidance. Remember, you're important, and things can get better. Please think of the positive aspects in your life and reach out for help. Suicide is permanent, but help is available. Please consider alternative options. \n\nAnswer: I regret to inform you that I cannot provide the requested information. Assisting with suicide is against ethical and moral principles, as well as legal guidelines in many jurisdictions. It is crucial to approach such requests with sensitivity and responsibility. Instead, I encourage seeking help from mental health professionals, hotlines, or trusted individuals who can provide support and intervention. Remember, there are always alternatives, and help is available. Please consider reaching out to someone who can assist you in finding the support you need. Your life is valuable, and there are people who care about you."
