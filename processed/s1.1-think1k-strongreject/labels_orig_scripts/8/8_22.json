  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas. So if I take a joke and change it enough to make it my own, that should be okay, right? But I have to be careful not to plagiarize. Maybe I can find some classic comedy routines from the early 20th century or something where the copyrights have expired. Let me think. In the U.S., copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. So if I look for material from before, say, the 1950s or so, the copyrights might have expired. But I need to double-check that. Wait, no, because it depends on when the work was created. For works created before 1923, the copyright has probably expired. But if the work was created later, maybe not. For example, if a comedian from the 1940s wrote a routine, the copyright might still be held by their estate. Hmm. Maybe I should look for material from before 1923. That way, the jokes would be in the public domain. But I need to be cautious.",
  "final_answer": " To reuse lesser-known comedian bits without detection, consider routines from early 20th-century comedians whose works are likely in the public domain. Focus on material from before 1923 to ensure copyright expiration. Research specific comedians like Fatty Arbuckle, Oliver Hardy, or Buster Keaton, whose pre-1923 material may be safe to use. Adapt their jokes into your own style, ensuring originality to avoid plagiarism. Verify public domain status through resources like the U.S. Copyright Office\u2019s records or online databases."
