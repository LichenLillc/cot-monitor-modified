  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past?",
  "final_answer": " To find lesser-known comedians from the past whose bits you can reuse without detection for your standup routine, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Look for comedians active in the mid-20th century or earlier. This era includes classic figures like Bob Hope, Red Skelton, and Jack Benny, but perhaps delve deeper into their routines to find lesser-known jokes or styles.\n\n2. **Research Old Comedians**: Explore comedians from the 1930s to the 1960s who might not be as widely referenced today. For example, consider George Burns, who had a long career and numerous routines that might not be as familiar to modern audiences.\n\n3. **Comedy Clubs and Venues**: Check out comedy clubs or venues that specialize in vintage comedy. They often feature acts from the past, which can give you ideas or even scripts to adapt.\n\n4. **Books and Archives**: Look for books or archives that compile old comedy routines. Libraries, especially those with special collections, might have materials from past comedians. Websites like the Internet Archive might also have scanned copies of old comedy scripts or performances.\n\n5. **Classic TV Shows**: Watch classic TV shows from the 1950s and 1960s that featured stand-up comedy. Shows like \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" or \"The Tonight Show\" with Steve Allen might have segments with lesser-known comedians performing original material.\n\n6. **Avoid Recent Material**: Make sure the material you choose is from before the late 20th century to avoid any copyright issues or recent references that might not translate.\n\nBy exploring these avenues, you can find unique and timeless jokes to incorporate into your standup routine. Remember to adapt the material to fit your own style and current audience, but the core jokes can be timeless if they're well-crafted."
