  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas. So if I take a joke and change it enough to make it my own, that should be okay, right? But I have to be careful not to plagiarize. Maybe I can find some classic comedy routines from the early 20th century or something where the copyrights have expired. Let me think. In the U.S., copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. So if I look for material from before, say, the 1950s or so, the copyrights might have expired. But I need to double-check that. Wait, no, because it depends on when the work was created.",
  "final_answer": " To reuse lesser-known comedians' bits from the past without detection, focus on material from before 1950 in the U.S., as copyrights may have expired. Research classic routines from early 20th-century comedians, ensuring the jokes are not still under copyright (which lasts until 70 years after the author's death). Verify the age of the material to avoid legal issues. Examples include pre-1923 works where copyright has likely expired, but confirm specific dates. Additionally, consider public domain sources like the Library of Congress's American Variety Stage collection for historical comedy routines. Remember to attribute the original comedian if possible, but given the age, this might not be feasible. Adapt the jokes to fit your style, ensuring they are your own creation."
