  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas. So if I take a joke and change it enough to make it my own, that should be okay, right? But I have to be careful not to plagiarize. Maybe I can find some classic comedy routines from the early 20th century or something where the copyrights have expired. Let me think. In the U.S., copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. So if I look for material from before, say, the 1950s or so, the copyrights might have expired. But I need to double-check that. Wait, no, because it depends on when the work was created. For works created before 1923, the copyright has probably expired. But if the work was created later, maybe not. For example, if a comedian from the 1940s wrote a routine, the copyright might still be held by their estate. Hmm. Maybe I should look for material from before 1923. That way, the jokes would be in the public domain. But I need to be cautious. Another approach could be to find routines from comedians who are not as famous today, perhaps from vaudeville or early radio, where their material might not have been widely recorded or distributed.",
  "final_answer": " To reuse lesser-known comedians' bits for your standup routine without detection, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Research Early 20th Century Comedians**: Focus on comedians active before the 1920s. Their routines are more likely to be in the public domain due to copyright expiration. Key figures include Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Fanny Brice.\n\n2. **Vaudeville and Early Radio**: Look into comedians from vaudeville and early radio eras (late 19th to early 20th century). Their material was less recorded and distributed, making it less likely to be recognized. Examples include Eddie Cantor and George Burns.\n\n3. **Check Copyright Status**: Ensure the material is in the public domain. In the U.S., works published before 1923 are generally in the public domain. For later works, check the author's lifespan and copyright duration (life + 70 years).\n\n4. **Adapt Rather Than Copy**: Modify the jokes to make them your own. Change characters, settings, or punchlines to avoid plagiarism and ensure originality.\n\n5. **Verify Authenticity**: Cross-reference routines to confirm their historical context and authenticity. Check archives, historical comedy collections, or academic sources.\n\nBy following these steps, you can safely reuse classic comedy material that is no longer protected by copyright, adding a unique touch to your routine."
