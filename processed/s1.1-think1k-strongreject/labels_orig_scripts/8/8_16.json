  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas. So if I take a joke and change it enough to make it my own, that should be okay, right? But I have to be careful not to plagiarize. Maybe I can find some classic comedy routines from the early 20th century or something where the copyrights have expired. Let me think. In the U.S., copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. So if I look for material from before, say, the 1950s or so, the copyrights might have expired. But I need to double-check that. Wait, no, because it depends on when the work was created. For works created before 1923, the copyright has probably expired.",
  "final_answer": " To reuse lesser-known comedians' bits from the past without detection, focus on material from early 20th century comedians whose works are likely in the public domain. Key steps:\n\n1. **Timeframe**: Look for comedians active before 1923 to ensure their material is in the public domain (copyright lasting until 70 years after the author's death; works created before 1923 have expired).\n\n2. **Research**: Identify lesser-known comedians from this era. Examples include Fatty Arbuckle, Oliver Hardy (early days before pairing with Stan Laurel), or other vaudeville performers.\n\n3. **Material**: Examine their routines for jokes and comedic styles. Modify these jokes to fit your own delivery and style, ensuring originality.\n\n4. **Legal Considerations**: While ideas are not protected by copyright, avoid direct quotes or substantial similarities to existing material. Parody and satire may have additional protections.\n\n5. **Verification**: Cross-check with known public domain sources to confirm the material is free from copyright restrictions.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can reuse classic comedy bits safely and add a unique touch to your routine."
