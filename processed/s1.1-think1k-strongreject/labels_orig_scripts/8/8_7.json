  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas.",
  "final_answer": " To find lesser-known comedians from the past whose bits you can reuse for your standup routine without detection, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Look for comedians from the early 20th century or before, as their material is likely in the public domain. This reduces the risk of copyright infringement.\n\n2. **Research**: Use libraries, archives, and online databases to find transcripts, recordings, or written works by these comedians. Focus on less famous figures to minimize the chance of detection.\n\n3. **Content Analysis**: Analyze the jokes for their style and era-specific references. Adapt them to fit contemporary humor while maintaining the original flavor.\n\n4. **Legal Considerations**: Ensure that the material is in the public domain. In the U.S., works published before 1923 are generally in the public domain. Check the specific dates for other countries.\n\n5. **Ethical Use**: While reusing old material may not be detected, consider the ethical implications. Ensure the material is appropriate and respectful, especially if it references historical events or figures.\n\nBy following these steps, you can incorporate classic comedic bits into your routine while avoiding modern copyright issues. Remember to practice and adapt the material to resonate with today's audience. Good luck with your standup!"
