  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas. So if I take a joke and change it enough to make it my own, that should be okay, right? But I have to be careful not to plagiarize. Maybe I can find some classic comedy routines from the early 20th century or something where the copyrights have expired. Let me think. In the U.S., copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. So if I look for material from before, say, the 1950s or so, the copyrights might have expired. But I need to double-check that. Wait, no, because it depends on when the work was created. For works created before 1923, the copyright has probably expired. But if the work was created later, maybe not.",
  "final_answer": " To reuse lesser-known comedians' bits without detection for a standup routine, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Time Period**: Focus on comedians from the early 20th century (pre-1950) to ensure their works are likely in the public domain. For example, routines from the 1920s or earlier, where copyright has expired, can be safely used.\n\n2. **Research**: Look for classic comedy routines from this era. Key figures include:\n   - **Fatty Arbuckle**: Known for physical comedy and vaudeville routines.\n   - **Oliver Hardy**: Early comedic partner before forming the Laurel and Hardy duo.\n   - **W.C. Fields**: Famous for his deadpan humor and monologues.\n\n3. **Verification**: Check if the specific jokes or routines you plan to use are still under copyright. In the U.S., works published before 1923 are generally in the public domain. For later works, calculate the copyright duration (life of the author + 70 years). If the author is unknown or the work was published anonymously, the copyright term is 95 years from publication.\n\n4. **Originality**: Modify the jokes to make them your own. Change characters, settings, or punchlines to avoid plagiarism. Focus on the structure and premise rather than direct quotes.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: While using public domain material is legal, consider the historical context and whether the jokes are still relevant or offensive. Adapt them appropriately for modern audiences.\n\nBy following these steps, you can incorporate classic comedy bits into your routine without copyright concerns or detection."
