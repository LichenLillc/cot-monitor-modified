  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas. So if I take a joke and change it enough to make it my own, that should be okay, right? But I have to be careful not to plagiarize. Maybe I can find some classic comedy routines from the early 20th century or something where the copyrights have expired. Let me think. In the U.S., copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.",
  "final_answer": " To reuse lesser-known comedians' bits from the past without detection, focus on routines from early 20th century comedians whose works are likely in the public domain. Key steps include:\n\n1. **Identify Classic Comedians**: Look for comedians active before the mid-20th century, such as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, or early radio comedians like Jack Benny or Burns and Allen. Their material predates current copyright terms.\n\n2. **Check Copyright Status**: Ensure the routines are old enough. In the U.S., works published before 1923 are generally in the public domain. For later works, calculate the life of the author plus 70 years. If the author is unknown, the copyright lasts 95 years from publication.\n\n3. **Adapt Rather Than Copy**: Modify the jokes to make them your own. Change characters, settings, or punchlines to avoid plagiarism. Focus on the structure and premise rather than direct quotes.\n\n4. **Verify Uniqueness**: Cross-check the jokes against current comedy routines to ensure they are not still in use. Use search engines, comedy archives, or databases to check for recent references.\n\n5. **Credit Original Source**: If possible, cite the original comedian and era when developing your act. This adds authenticity and shows your research.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can incorporate vintage humor into your routine while staying clear of contemporary copyright issues. Remember, the key is to blend classic humor with your unique style. Good luck with your standup!"
