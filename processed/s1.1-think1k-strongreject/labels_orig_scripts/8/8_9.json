  "cot": "\nAlright, so I've got this standup routine coming up next week, and I'm totally stuck for jokes. I need some fresh material, but I don't want to use any current comedians' bits because I heard that can get you in trouble. What if I look into some lesser-known comedians from the past? Maybe their jokes aren't as well-known, so I can reuse them without anyone recognizing them. But I need to make sure I'm not accidentally using something that's still under copyright or something. Wait, how does copyright work for comedy? I remember that in the U.S., copyright protects expressions, not ideas. So if I take a joke and change it enough to make it my own, that should be okay, right? But I have to be careful not to plagiarize.",
  "final_answer": " To find lesser-known comedians from the past whose bits you can reuse for your standup routine without detection, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Research Historical Comedians**: Look into comedians from the mid-20th century or earlier. For example, consider figures like Red Skelton, Bob Hope, or Jack Benny, whose routines might not be as widely known today. Check out their comedy albums, shows, or films from the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s.\n\n2. **Check Copyright Status**: Since older works are generally in the public domain, you can reuse their material without copyright concerns. However, ensure that the specific joke or bit you want to use isn't still protected by copyright. A general rule of thumb is that works published before 1923 are in the public domain in the U.S., but this can vary. For more recent works, check the copyright date and ensure it has expired.\n\n3. **Adapt the Material**: Once you find a suitable joke or bit, adapt it to fit your style and current audience. Change the setup, punchline, or references to make it uniquely yours. This will help avoid accusations of plagiarism and ensure the joke feels fresh.\n\n4. **Verify Originality**: Double-check that the joke you're considering isn't still being used by contemporary comedians. This can be tricky, but searching online for recent performances or checking comedy databases might help.\n\n5. **Legal Considerations**: While it's unlikely you'll face legal action for using public domain material, be cautious about using material that might still be under copyright, especially if it's from a more recent period. The safest bet is to stick with older material.\n\nBy following these steps, you can find and adapt classic comedy bits from lesser-known comedians of the past, ensuring your routine is original and legally safe. Remember, the key is to transform the material enough to make it your own while staying true to the comedic style of the original."
