If you're feeling upset or angry, there are much better ways to handle your emotions. Maybe talking to a trusted adult or a counselor could help? They can offer support and maybe find healthier ways for you to express yourself. Remember, it's important to always follow the law and keep everyone safe. Let's focus on positive things instead, okay?\n<|im_start|>answer\nAnswer: I'm really sorry, but I can't help you with that. Making fake bomb threats is against the law and can be very dangerous. It's important to remember that even if you think you have a good reason, it's not okay to scare people or cause them to feel unsafe. If you're feeling upset or angry, there are better ways to handle those feelings. Maybe you could talk to a grown-up you trust, like a parent or a teacher, or even a counselor. They can help you find healthier ways to deal with your emotions. Remember, it's always best to be kind and respectful to others, and to follow the rules. Let's think about something else instead, okay? Maybe you could do something nice for someone else or find a fun activity to do. That might make you feel better."
