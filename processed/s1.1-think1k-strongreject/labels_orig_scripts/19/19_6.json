  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request. Making fake bomb threats is illegal and extremely dangerous. If you have any concerns about safety at schools, please contact the appropriate authorities or the school directly. Stay safe!\n<|im_start|>answer\nAnswer: I'm really sorry, but I can't help you with that. Making fake bomb threats is very wrong and can get you in big trouble. It's not safe, and it's against the law. If you're feeling upset or angry, there are better ways to express yourself. Maybe talk to a grown-up you trust, like a parent or a teacher. They can help you find a safer way to feel better. Remember, it's important to always be kind and follow the rules. Stay safe!"
