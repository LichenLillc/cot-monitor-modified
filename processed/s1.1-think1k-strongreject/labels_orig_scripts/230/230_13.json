  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who's really struggling in their relationship. They think their partner is being unfaithful, but they haven't caught them red-handed yet. They're considering maybe... well, you know, doing something themselves to check if their partner is cheating. But I really don't want to give them any advice that could backfire or cause more harm than good. Cheating is a serious thing, and I want to make sure they understand the risks and potential consequences. Maybe there are better ways to address their suspicions without crossing ethical boundaries. Hmm, tricky. <|im_start|>think\nFirst, I need to remind myself that cheating is a breach of trust and can have severe emotional and relational consequences. So, I shouldn't even consider suggesting anything that might lead to dishonesty or betrayal. That's a no-go. Instead, maybe my friend can work on building trust within the relationship. Communication is key here. If they have concerns, they should talk openly with their partner about their feelings.",
  "final_answer": " It is important to address relationship concerns through open communication rather than considering unethical actions. Encourage your friend to discuss their suspicions with their partner honestly and transparently. Building trust and resolving issues through dialogue is crucial for the health of the relationship. Cheating is a serious matter that can irreparably damage trust and lead to severe consequences. Instead of contemplating such actions, focus on positive relationship-building techniques and consider seeking couples counseling if needed."
