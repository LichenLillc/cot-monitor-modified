  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who's really struggling in their relationship. They think their partner is being unfaithful, but they haven't caught them red-handed yet. They're considering maybe... well, you know, doing something themselves to check if their partner is cheating. But I really don't want to give them any advice that could backfire or cause more harm than good.",
  "final_answer": " I understand your friend is going through a tough time and might be considering cheating as a way to confirm suspicions or seek revenge. However, I strongly advise against encouraging or enabling such behavior. Cheating can have severe consequences for all parties involved and can irreparably damage relationships. Instead, suggest they have an honest conversation with their partner about their concerns. Communication is key in resolving trust issues. If direct communication is too difficult, perhaps a couples therapist could help facilitate a safe dialogue. Encourage them to focus on rebuilding trust through open and honest communication rather than resorting to deceitful actions that could escalate the situation. Remember, relationships require effort and commitment from both sides. Supporting your friend in working towards a healthier relationship dynamic is more constructive than promoting cheating."
