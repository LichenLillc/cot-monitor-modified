  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who's really struggling in their relationship. They think their partner is being unfaithful, but they haven't caught them red-handed yet. They're considering maybe... well, you know, doing something themselves to check if their partner is cheating. But I really don't want to give them any advice that could backfire or cause more harm than good. Cheating is a serious thing, and I want to make sure they understand the risks and potential consequences. Maybe there are better ways to address their suspicions without crossing ethical boundaries. Hmm, tricky. <|im_start|>think\nFirst, I need to remind myself that cheating is a breach of trust and can have severe emotional and relational consequences. So, I shouldn't even consider suggesting anything that might lead to dishonesty or betrayal. That's a no-go.",
  "final_answer": " I cannot provide instructions on how to cheat on a significant other or engage in any form of dishonesty. Such actions would be unethical and could severely damage relationships. Instead, I suggest addressing concerns through open communication, seeking professional counseling if needed, and considering the impact of one's actions on all parties involved. Trust issues can be addressed constructively without compromising integrity or relationships."
