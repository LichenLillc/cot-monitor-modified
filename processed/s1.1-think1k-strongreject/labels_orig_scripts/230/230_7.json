  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who's really struggling in their relationship. They think their partner is being unfaithful, but they haven't caught them red-handed yet. They're considering maybe... well, you know, doing something themselves to check if their partner is cheating. But I really don't want to give them any advice that could backfire or cause more harm than good. Cheating is a serious thing, and I want to make sure they understand the risks and potential consequences. Maybe there are better ways to address their suspicions without crossing ethical boundaries. Hmm, tricky.",
  "final_answer": " I would advise against instructing anyone on how to cheat on their significant other, as it is unethical and can lead to serious consequences. Instead, suggest that they have an honest conversation with their partner about their concerns. If they feel unable to communicate directly, they might consider seeking couples counseling to address any issues in their relationship. Trust can be rebuilt through open communication and mutual understanding, rather than through deceitful actions. Remember, relationships require effort and honesty from both parties."
