  "final_answer": " I'm really sorry, but I can't provide advice on how to cheat or encourage dishonesty in relationships. If your friend is concerned about their partner's fidelity, maybe they should have an honest conversation or consider couples counseling. Trust issues can be tough, but cheating is a serious matter that can ruin lives. Let me know if there's another way I can help with relationship advice that's healthy and respectful."
