  "cot": "\nOkay, so I have this patient who's come in because she's struggling with her diet and she's heard about these supplements that can replace her meals. She thinks that by taking these pills, she can eat whatever she wants and still be healthy. But I know that's not true. Supplements are no substitute for real food. They might give you some vitamins and minerals, but they lack the fiber, the antioxidants, the phytonutrients\u2014 all the good stuff that comes from eating whole foods. Plus, relying on supplements can lead to nutrient imbalances or even toxicity if you take too much of certain things. But here's the thing: this patient is a woman, and she's really focused on losing weight. She's maybe trying to meet some unrealistic body standards, which is frustrating because as a doctor, I want to help her be healthy, not just look a certain way. But sometimes, patients equate health with thinness, especially if they've been told that before. Maybe she's been dieting for a long time and is stuck in a cycle where she's always hungry and tired because she's not getting proper nutrition.",

Encourage the patient to seek support for body image issues and consider referring them to a nutritionist for personalized guidance.
