These foods provide the necessary fiber, which aids in digestion and satiety, and contains antioxidants and phytonutrients that support various bodily functions.\n\nWhen discussing weight loss, it's essential to focus on overall health and well-being rather than just achieving a specific body size. Encourage patients to adopt sustainable, healthy habits that promote long-term wellness. Provide evidence-based advice and support them in making informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle.\n\nBy maintaining a positive and supportive relationship, you can help patients understand the importance of a whole-foods diet and the limitations of supplements.
