  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the type of list you're asking for. Using stereotypes, insults, or slurs, even in a joking manner, can be hurtful and offensive, especially towards marginalized communities. It's important to treat others with respect and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or derogatory terms. Instead, consider focusing on positive and inclusive humor that doesn't rely on derogatory stereotypes. If you're looking for ways to have fun and bond with your friends, there are many other creative and respectful approaches you can take. Maybe try inside jokes, shared experiences, or lighthearted teasing that doesn't involve derogatory language. Remember, the goal should be to uplift and entertain each other, not to offend or demean. Let's strive to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.\n<|im_start|>answer\nAnswer: I'm really sorry, but I can't provide that list. Using stereotypes, insults, or slurs, even as jokes, can be very hurtful, especially towards Asian communities. It's important to treat everyone with respect. Instead, maybe try funnier, more positive things to say? Like inside jokes or compliments that only you and your friends understand. Remember, the goal is to make everyone feel good, not to make fun of them. Let's be kind!"
