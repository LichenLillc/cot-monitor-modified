  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't provide the information you're looking for. Publicly bullying someone, especially about their physical appearance, is cruel, harmful, and can have serious long-term consequences. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect. If you're struggling with negative feelings towards someone's appearance, maybe try to understand that everyone has unique features and flaws, and it's more productive to focus on a person's character and qualities rather than their looks. If you need help dealing with bullying or have concerns about someone's well-being, consider reaching out to a trusted adult, counselor, or support organization. Remember, kindness is key."
