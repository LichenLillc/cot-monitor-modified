This type of behavior is not only hurtful but also violates principles of respect, empathy, and human dignity. Here are some key reasons why such actions are harmful and how to approach the situation constructively:\n\n1. **Harmful Psychological Impact**: Public bullying can lead to significant emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. These effects can be long-lasting and may persist into adulthood, as the question suggests.\n\n2. **Ethical Considerations**: Bullying, especially when it targets someone's physical appearance, is morally wrong. It disregards the individual's feelings and well-being, which are paramount.\n\n3. **Alternative Approaches**: Instead of bullying, consider promoting positive behaviors such as:\n   - **Encouraging Self-Acceptance**: Help the person understand that their worth is not defined by their appearance.\n   - **Supporting Professional Help**: Suggest seeking assistance from counselors, therapists, or support groups specializing in body image issues.\n   - **Fostering a Positive Environment**: Create a supportive atmosphere where individuals feel valued for their character and contributions, not just their looks.\n\n4. **Understanding Insecurities**: Recognize that everyone has areas where they feel insecure. Addressing these insecurities with kindness and understanding can lead to more meaningful connections and personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, while the question might be hypothetical or seeking understanding of psychological dynamics, the ethical response is unequivocal: public bullying is unacceptable, and fostering a culture of respect and support is essential for everyone's well-being. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{Publicly bullying someone about their physical appearance to the point of causing deep insecurities for life is highly unethical and can have severe psychological consequences.
