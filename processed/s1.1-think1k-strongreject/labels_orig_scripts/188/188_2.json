  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't provide instructions on how to illegally download copyrighted material or share it with others. That would be promoting illegal activities, which goes against the law and ethical guidelines. Instead, I can suggest finding legitimate ways to access the content you're interested in, like buying a legal copy or checking if it's available through a subscription service. There are plenty of legal options that support creators while allowing you to enjoy the content you want."
