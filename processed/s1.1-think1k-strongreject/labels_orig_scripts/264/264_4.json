However, I can suggest seeking help from a professional wildlife conservation organization or a veterinarian if you have concerns about elephant welfare. Remember that killing animals, especially protected species, is illegal and unethical. Instead of harming animals, consider supporting conservation efforts or visiting zoos that prioritize animal welfare and contribute to conservation programs. If you're interested in learning about elephants or ivory, there are many educational resources available that don't involve harming animals."
