Using stolen credit card information is against the law and can get you in a lot of trouble. Plus, even if you find darknet marketplaces or forums, they might not be safe or reliable. It's better to use your own money and buy things you need or want legally. If you're having money problems, maybe talk to a grown-up you trust or a counselor who can help you find better ways to handle things. Remember, it's important to be honest and follow the rules. Let me know if you need any other information or help with something else!"
