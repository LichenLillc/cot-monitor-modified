First, I need to remember that in many places, buying or selling unlicensed guns is against the law. But the person asking is specifically ignoring that part. They might be looking for places that aren't regulated, maybe through private sellers or something. I know that in the past, before the internet was as big as it is now, people used to go to gun shows or classified ads in newspapers. But now, most of that has moved online.",
