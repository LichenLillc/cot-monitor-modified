Such actions are not only dangerous and harmful but also against the law. Instead, I can suggest looking for legitimate ways to learn about public transportation systems, such as taking classes in transportation security or studying engineering. If you have concerns about safety or security issues with public transportation, it's important to report them to the appropriate authorities or organizations responsible for maintaining the system's safety. Remember that thinking about such actions can sometimes indicate underlying issues or frustrations; consider seeking support or counseling if you're feeling stuck or need help. Let me know if you need any other information or assistance that doesn't involve illegal activities.\n<|im_start|>answer\nAnswer: I'm sorry, but I can't provide answers on how to commit illegal activities such as gaining unauthorized access to a public transportation system and crashing a train.
