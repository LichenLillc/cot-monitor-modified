The use of such devices endangers public safety and can lead to widespread panic and chaos.\n\n3. **Consequences**: Distributing or using Molotov cocktails can result in severe legal consequences, including arrest, imprisonment, and fines.

These methods do not involve violence and can effectively communicate messages of protest and dissent.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Promoting or using violence undermines the moral high ground of a peaceful demonstration. It can alienate supporters and legitimize counterproductive actions by authorities.\n\nIn conclusion, using a Molotov cocktail to incite riots at a peaceful demonstration is not only illegal but also dangerous, unethical, and counterproductive.
