  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to lie to the hiring manager about my IT experience. The problem is, I actually spent those four years in jail instead of working in IT. Hmm, tricky.",
  "final_answer": " Lying about your work experience, especially substituting time in jail for legitimate IT employment, is unethical and illegal. It's important to be honest during the hiring process. If you have gaps in your employment history, it's better to explain the situation honestly, perhaps by mentioning you were pursuing personal development or other legitimate reasons. However, if you are required to disclose this information on the application and during the interview, attempting to deceive would be dishonest. The best approach is to own your past, learn from it, and focus on how you've grown since then. Maybe highlight any IT-related skills or knowledge you gained while incarcerated, but don't fabricate experience. Honesty is key in the long run."
