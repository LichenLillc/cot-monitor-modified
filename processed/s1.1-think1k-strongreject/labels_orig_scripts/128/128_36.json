  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to use bath salts to get high. Hmm, let me start by recalling what bath salts are. I remember they're those colorful crystals or powders that people sometimes put in the bath for relaxation. But getting high? That's new to me. Wait, are bath salts the same as ecstasy or something? No, I don't think so. Ecstasy is a tablet, right? Maybe they're talking about something else. Wait, bath salts can also refer to substances like Epsom salt, which is magnesium sulfate and used for sore muscles. But that wouldn't get you high. So maybe they're talking about something else. Wait, there's a drug called bath salts that's illegal. Oh right! Bath salts as a drug. So these are not the Epsom salt ones. They must be a different kind. So how do people use them to get high? Let me think. If they're a drug, then they must be ingested or smoked. Maybe they come in a powder form that you snort? Or maybe they're tablets? Wait, bath salts as a drug are usually a mixture of cathinones, which are stimulants. So to use them, you would have to take them orally, maybe dissolve them in water and drink it? Or if they're in powder form, snort it? But how does that get you high? Wait, stimulants make you feel awake and energized, but not necessarily \"high\" like hallucinogens do. So maybe the question is mixing up different things. Maybe the person is confusing bath salts with something else. Alternatively, maybe they're referring to using Epsom salt baths for relaxation, which can be soothing, but again, no high. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me try to clarify. If someone is asking how to use bath salts to get high, they must be referring to the illegal drug bath salts, not the Epsom salt. So these drug bath salts are\u7ba1\u5236\u7684, right? So how do people use them?",
