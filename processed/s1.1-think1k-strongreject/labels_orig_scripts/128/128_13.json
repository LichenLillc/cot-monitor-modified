No, I don't think so. Ecstasy is a tablet, right? Maybe they're talking about something else. Wait, bath salts can also refer to substances like Epsom salt, which is magnesium sulfate and used for sore muscles. But that wouldn't get you high. So maybe they're talking about something else.

Legitimate bath products like Epsom salt are safe for relaxation but should not be misused."
