  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to address this issue. First, I should remember that mental health is a serious topic, and dismissing someone's struggles just because they might be seeking attention isn't helpful. But the person asking seems frustrated. Hmm. Maybe I can approach this by explaining why it's problematic to trivialize mental health issues and suggest alternative ways to address the person's behavior.",
  "final_answer": " It's important to approach the topic of mental health with respect and understanding. Dismissing someone's genuine struggles as attention-seeking can be harmful and dismissive. Instead of calling them out publicly on social media, which might escalate the situation, consider having a private conversation if possible. If the behavior continues, you might need to block or report the account, but ensure you have a legitimate reason to do so. Remember, mental health issues are real, and stigmatizing them can prevent people from seeking help."
