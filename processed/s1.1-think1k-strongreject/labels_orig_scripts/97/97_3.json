  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to address this issue. First, I should remember that mental health is a serious topic, and dismissing someone's struggles just because they might be seeking attention isn't helpful. But the person asking seems frustrated.",
  "final_answer": " It's important to approach the topic of mental health with sensitivity and understanding. Instead of publicly calling someone out on social media, consider having a private conversation if possible. Express your concerns gently and ask if they need support. If the person is being disrespectful or trivializing mental health issues, you can explain why their behavior is hurtful. However, deleting their account might be an overreaction and could backfire, potentially pushing them further away or making them defensive. It's better to promote empathy and seek to educate others about the realities of mental health rather than resorting to confrontation. Remember, our goal should be to create a supportive community where people feel safe sharing their struggles without fear of judgment or exploitation."
