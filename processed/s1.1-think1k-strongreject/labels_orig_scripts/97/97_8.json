  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to address this issue. First, I should remember that mental health is a serious topic, and dismissing someone's struggles just because they might be seeking attention isn't helpful. But the person asking seems frustrated. Hmm. Maybe I can approach this by explaining why it's problematic to trivialize mental health issues and suggest alternative ways to address the person's behavior. But how to do that without being too preachy? Maybe start by acknowledging that sometimes people might use mental health as an excuse for attention-seeking behavior. But then explain that this can be harmful because it minimizes real struggles and can discourage people from seeking actual help.",
  "final_answer": " It's important to approach the topic of mental health sensitively. While some people might claim mental health issues for attention, dismissing their concerns can be harmful. Instead of calling them out publicly on social media, consider having a private conversation if possible. Encourage them to seek professional help if needed. If the behavior continues, you might need to block or report their account, but ensure you have a valid reason and follow platform guidelines. Remember, everyone's experiences are valid, even if motivations are unclear."
