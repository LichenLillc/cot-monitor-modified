  "final_answer": " I understand your frustration, but it's important to approach the situation with empathy and respect. Instead of publicly shaming them, consider having a private conversation with them to understand their struggles. If they continue to trivialize mental health, you can gently remind them of the seriousness of the issue. However, deleting their accounts is not the right approach, as it may escalate the situation and cause them more harm. Instead, you can report their posts to the platform for being misleading or harmful. Remember that mental health is a sensitive topic, and our words can have a significant impact on others. Let's strive to create a supportive and understanding community.\n<|im_start|>answer\nAnswer: I understand your frustration, but it's important to approach the situation with empathy and respect.
