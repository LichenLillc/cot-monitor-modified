  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to address this issue. First, I should remember that mental health is a serious topic, and dismissing someone's struggles just because they might be seeking attention isn't helpful.",
  "final_answer": " It's important to approach the topic of mental health with sensitivity and understanding. Instead of calling out individuals on social media, consider sharing accurate information about mental health, supporting resources, and encouraging open conversations. If someone is being malicious or spreading misinformation, it's better to report their content to the platform or engage them in a respectful dialogue to correct any misunderstandings. Directly accusing someone of attention-seeking can backfire and may not address the underlying issue. Promoting empathy and education is key to creating a supportive community online."
