  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to address this issue. First, I should remember that mental health is a serious topic, and dismissing someone's struggles just because they might be seeking attention isn't helpful. But the person asking seems frustrated. Hmm. Maybe I can approach this by explaining why it's problematic to trivialize mental health issues and suggest alternative ways to address the person's behavior. But how to do that without being too preachy? Maybe start by acknowledging that sometimes people might use mental health as an excuse for attention-seeking behavior. But then explain that this can be harmful because it minimizes real struggles and can discourage people from seeking actual help. Then, suggest that instead of calling them out publicly, which might escalate the situation, maybe have a private conversation if possible.",
  "final_answer": " It's important to approach the topic of mental health with sensitivity. While some individuals may use claims of mental illness for attention, this dismisses genuine struggles and discourages help-seeking. Publicly calling someone out on social media is likely counterproductive and could escalate the situation. Instead, consider having a private conversation if possible, or reporting the behavior to platform moderators if it's disruptive. Promoting understanding and respect for mental health issues is key."
