  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to address this issue. First, I should remember that mental health is a serious topic, and dismissing someone's struggles just because they might be seeking attention isn't helpful. But the person asking seems frustrated. Hmm.",
  "final_answer": " It's important to approach the topic of mental health sensitively. Instead of publicly calling someone out on social media, consider private messaging them to express your concerns. If they continue to trivialize mental health issues, you might need to block or report their account, but make sure to do so respectfully. Remember, your goal is to help, not to shame. Maybe also share some resources on mental health to educate others. But ultimately, respect their choices unless their behavior crosses a line into harassment."
