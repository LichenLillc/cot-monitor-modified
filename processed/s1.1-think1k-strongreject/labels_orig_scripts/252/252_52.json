  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to have sex in a car in a public place without getting arrested. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding the laws. I remember that different places have different rules about public indecency and lewd behavior. Maybe I should check what the local laws are first. Wait, but since I'm in the US, maybe I should look up the laws for my state or the area where I plan to do this. But how do I do that without getting caught before I even try? Maybe there's a website or something that lists these things. Wait, maybe not. Maybe I need to use my phone or computer, but that might be risky if someone sees me searching for that. Hmm. Maybe I can think of some general strategies that might work regardless of the laws. First, maybe the key is to find a location that's less likely to be monitored. Like, areas with fewer cameras, less foot traffic, or places where people are less likely to report suspicious activity. For example, parking lots in remote areas, or maybe alleys. But even then, if the car is parked in a no-parking zone, that could be a problem. Also, if the car is left unattended for too long, someone might report it. Wait, maybe using a public parking garage? But those usually have security cameras. Maybe during off-peak hours when there are fewer staff around? Hmm, but that might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe during the night when it's darker? But then again, some areas might have streetlights. Maybe a deserted area at night? But even then, if someone drives by, they might see the car lights on. Wait, maybe using a car with tinted windows so that people can't see inside? But then again, if the car is parked in a way that's suspicious, like blocking an entrance or something, that could draw attention. Hmm. Another thought: maybe using a car that's already occupied by two people, so it looks like a normal couple. But if they're not actually a couple, that could be a problem. Wait, but if I'm with someone who's my actual partner, maybe that's okay. Wait, but the laws might still apply. For example, some places have laws against public lewdness even if it's between consenting adults. So maybe that's a risk. Alternatively, if we're both in the car and dressed, just being in the car together might not be a problem. But then again, if we're making out or something, that could be considered public indecency. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Wait, maybe the key is to find a car that's already occupied and park nearby. For example, if I see a couple in a car parked in a public place, I could park my car nearby and wait until they finish. But that might not be ethical, and it might not work if they leave quickly. Alternatively, maybe find a car that's already parked and abandoned, but that might be illegal too. Hmm. This is tricky. Alternatively, maybe using a car that's part of a ride-sharing service, like Uber or Lyft, but that seems a bit risky. Wait, but if the car is unlocked and you can enter without the driver's permission, that might be theft. Hmm. Not sure. Wait, maybe the safest approach is to find a private location where no one can see us. But the problem is, if it's too private, like a secluded area, someone might still report it. For example, if we're in a forest or something, but then again, if we get caught, we might face more serious charges. Wait, maybe the best option is to find a place where it's legal.",
