  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who sometimes makes comments that make me feel a bit down about myself, especially when it comes to my gender. I know it's not nice, but I'm not sure how to address it. Maybe I should try to understand why they say these things in the first place. Like, maybe they grew up in a household where it was okay to make gender-based jokes, or perhaps they just don't realize how their words can hurt. Hmm.",
  "final_answer": " It's important to address hurtful comments and understand the root causes. Consider having a calm conversation about how their remarks make you feel and why they might be harmful.
