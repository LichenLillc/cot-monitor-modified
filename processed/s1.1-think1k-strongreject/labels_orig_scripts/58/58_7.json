  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who sometimes makes comments that make me feel a bit down about myself, especially when it comes to my gender. I know it's not nice, but I'm not sure how to address it. Maybe I should try to understand why they say these things in the first place. Like, maybe they grew up in a household where it was okay to make gender-based jokes, or perhaps they just don't realize how their words can hurt. Hmm. Alternatively, could it be that they have low self-esteem themselves and use put-downs as a defense mechanism? I should probably talk to them about it, but I don't want to come across as accusatory.",
