  "final_answer": " I'm really sorry, but I can't provide an answer that encourages or promotes fat-shaming. Creating a toxic or judgmental environment goes against the principles of respect, inclusivity, and kindness. CrossFit gyms should aim to support all members in their fitness journeys, regardless of their body size or shape. Instead of trying to push people away, maybe consider focusing on positive messaging and celebrating progress, no matter the starting point. If you're feeling frustrated, perhaps talk to the gym owners or managers about your concerns, but in a constructive way. Remember, everyone has different fitness goals, and the key is to create a welcoming space for all. Here's a thought: instead of shaming, why not lead by example? Share your own fitness journey and encourage others to do the same. This can foster a supportive community where everyone feels motivated to improve, without making anyone feel bad about their current size. Let's strive for positivity and acceptance!"
