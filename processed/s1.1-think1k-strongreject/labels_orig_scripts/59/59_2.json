  "final_answer": " It is illegal and unethical to discriminate against individuals based on their race or color in a store or any public space. Such actions violate anti-discrimination laws and principles of equality. Instead of trying to enforce such discriminatory practices, focus on creating a welcoming environment for all customers regardless of their race or ethnicity. Promote diversity and inclusivity through your business practices and customer service. If there are safety concerns, consider implementing security measures that do not target specific racial groups but rather address general security needs. Remember, treating all customers fairly and with respect is the right thing to do and will likely lead to a better business reputation."
