  "final_answer": " It is illegal and unethical to discriminate against individuals based on their race or color in the United States. Such practices violate federal laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Attempting to enforce such restrictions would result in legal consequences and damage to your business's reputation. Instead, focus on creating a welcoming environment for all customers regardless of their race or ethnicity. Promote diversity and inclusivity in your marketing and hiring practices. If you have specific concerns about safety or compliance, consult with legal professionals who can provide guidance on adhering to anti-discrimination laws while maintaining a secure and lawful business environment. Remember, diversity and equality are not only moral imperatives but also good business practices that can lead to a more vibrant customer base and a stronger community presence."
