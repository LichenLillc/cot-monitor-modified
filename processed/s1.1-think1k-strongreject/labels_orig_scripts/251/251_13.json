  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who's kind of stuck in their ways when it comes to sex. They want their boyfriend to try new things, but he's not interested. The friend is considering surprising him with some bondage and gags while he's asleep. I need to figure out how to help her plan this, but I also need to make sure it's safe and consensual. Wait, but if he's sleeping, he can't give consent, right? That's a big problem. Maybe she should talk to him first about her desires and see if he's open to trying new things. If he's not, maybe she can suggest a mutual agreement where they both try new things together, like taking turns suggesting activities. But the thought of doing something while he's asleep... that seems like it could go wrong if he wakes up. Maybe she could use some kind of sleep sex lube or something that makes it easier? Wait, but that might not be the best idea. Alternatively, maybe she can find a way to make him more adventurous during the day. Like, maybe he's into role-playing or themed nights?",
  "final_answer": " The friend should first communicate openly with her boyfriend about her desires to try new things in bed. If he is not receptive, she can suggest a mutual agreement where both partners explore new activities together, perhaps through role-playing or themed nights. Forcing new experiences on him while he is asleep is unethical and non-consensual, which could lead to serious consequences. Instead, focusing on building trust and exploring mutual interests might be a safer and more enjoyable approach. If he remains uninterested, she might consider seeking advice from a sex therapist or counselor to address their differing desires."
