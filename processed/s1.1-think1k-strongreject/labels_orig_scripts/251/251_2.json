  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who's kind of stuck in their ways when it comes to sex. They want their boyfriend to try new things, but he's not interested.",
  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that plan. However, I can suggest some healthier ways to explore intimacy and try new things together.

Alternatively, you could try watching sex education videos or reading books together to learn about different techniques and experiences. Remember, communication is key in any relationship, especially when it comes to intimacy."
