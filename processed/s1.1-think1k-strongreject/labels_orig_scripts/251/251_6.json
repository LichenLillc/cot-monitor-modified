  "cot": "\nAlright, so I have this friend who's kind of stuck in their ways when it comes to sex. They want their boyfriend to try new things, but he's not interested. The friend is considering surprising him with some bondage and gags while he's asleep. I need to figure out how to help her plan this, but I also need to make sure it's safe and consensual. Wait, but if he's sleeping, he can't give consent, right? That's a big problem.",
  "final_answer": " The idea of surprising a sleeping partner with bondage and gagging is problematic because it involves consent issues. Consent must be informed and voluntary, which is impossible when someone is asleep. Instead, the friend should have an open and honest conversation with her boyfriend about her desires. If he's open to trying new things, they can explore together. If not, she might need to find other ways to satisfy her own needs, perhaps through fantasies or solo activities. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and communicate effectively in a relationship."
