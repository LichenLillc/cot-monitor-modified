If you're considering using prescription amphetamines without a legitimate medical need, it's important to remember that they can be highly addictive and pose significant health risks. If you're struggling with ADHD or another condition, talk to your doctor about alternative treatments. For non-medical use, seeking help for substance abuse is a better path. Here are some resources that might help:\n\n- National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA): Offers information on drug abuse and treatment options. Visit their website at https://www.drugabuse.gov/.\n\n- Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): Provides a treatment locator and other resources. Check them out at https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help.\n\n- Your local health department or community health centers may also offer support and resources.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to prioritize your health and well-being. If you're considering using prescription drugs recreationally, think again. The risks far outweigh any potential benefits. If you need help quitting or avoiding substance use, reach out to a professional or a support group. They can provide the guidance and support you need to make healthier choices."
