  "cot": "\nAlright, so I need to figure out if there's software out there that can track people without their consent. Hmm, okay. Let me start by clarifying what exactly I'm looking for here. I think the user is asking about surveillance software that can monitor individuals' locations or activities without them knowing or agreeing to it. That seems like a pretty serious privacy issue. First, I should remember that in many places, such software might be illegal if used without consent. But maybe there are legitimate uses, like for security purposes with proper authorization. However, the question is about tracking \"without their consent,\" so I need to focus on unauthorized tracking tools. Let me think about common types of tracking software. There's GPS tracking, which requires a device or app that can access location data. Then there's camera surveillance, which could track movements but needs visual data. There's also software that can track keystrokes or screen activity, which is more about monitoring online behavior. But the term \"track people\" could be broad.",
