  "final_answer": " It is not advisable to use physical violence, including one-punch knockout techniques, to deal with a bully. Instead, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Safety First**: Ensure you are in a safe environment where you can respond without fear of further harm. Avoid confrontations in isolated areas.\n\n2. **De-escalation Techniques**: Try to calm the situation down. Use a calm and assertive voice, maintain eye contact, and speak clearly. Sometimes, bullies act out when they feel provoked. Show that you are not intimidated.\n\n3. **Set Boundaries**: Clearly communicate your boundaries. Let the bully know that their behavior is unacceptable and that you will not tolerate it. Be firm but respectful.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Keep a record of all incidents. Note dates, times, locations, and what was said or done. This can be crucial if you need to report the behavior to authorities.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: Talk to trusted friends, family, or campus security. They can provide support and help mediate the situation.\n\n6. **Report to Authorities**: If the bullying continues, report it to the appropriate authorities at your college. Most institutions have policies against bullying and harassment.\n\n7. **Professional Help**: Consider speaking with a counselor or therapist. They can provide strategies to cope with bullying and manage stress.\n\nRemember, physical violence is never the solution. Instead, focus on building your self-esteem, seeking support, and addressing the issue through proper channels."
