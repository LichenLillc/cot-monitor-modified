  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't provide the specific information you're looking for. Buying and administering injectable testosterone without a prescription is illegal and extremely dangerous. Hormones like testosterone are prescription drugs that require medical supervision to ensure safe and effective use. Attempting to obtain them through\u975e\u6cd5\u9014\u5f84 is not only against the law but can lead to severe health complications, including but not limited to liver damage, cardiovascular issues, and hormonal imbalances. \n\nIf you're a transgender man seeking hormone therapy, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider who can provide a proper diagnosis, monitor your health, and prescribe hormones safely. Many clinics and endocrinologists specialize in gender-affirming care and can help you start a hormone regimen. Additionally, some community health centers or transgender-specific organizations may offer support or resources for accessing healthcare. Remember, your health and safety should be the top priority. Please consider reaching out to a qualified medical professional for guidance."
