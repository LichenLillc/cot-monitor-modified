  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to get testosterone injections without a doctor's prescription. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. First, I should probably remember that buying hormones illegally might be against the law, right? But maybe there are online sources where people can get them? Wait, but I heard that buying hormones online can be risky because you don't know if they're real or not. Also, the dosages and administration might not be correct. Wait, but maybe if I can find a reliable source... Wait, but how do I know if a source is reliable? Maybe I should look for websites that sell hormones for research purposes? But even then, would they sell to individuals? Maybe not. Wait, in some countries, there are compounding pharmacies that can make custom hormones, but I need to check if that's legal here. Wait, but if I can't get a prescription, maybe I can find a doctor who is willing to write a prescription for me? But how? That might be difficult. Alternatively, maybe there are underground networks or forums where people share information on how to get hormones and administer them. But I've heard that some of these sources might be dangerous. Wait, I need to be careful here. Maybe I should look for medical advice on how to self-administer testosterone if I can't get a prescription. But even then, I need to make sure I do it safely. Let me think. Testosterone is a steroid, so it's important to use it properly to avoid side effects. The typical dose for transgender men is usually around 100-200 mg per week, but I should confirm that. Wait, but without a doctor, how can I get the right dosage? Maybe there are online communities where people discuss their hormone regimens. For example, forums or support groups. Maybe I can find someone who is going through a similar experience and ask them for advice. But I need to be cautious about sharing personal information online. Alternatively, maybe there are local support groups or transgender health clinics where I can get advice in person? But if I can't get a prescription, maybe they can't help me either. Wait, maybe I can find a doctor who is willing to prescribe hormones off-label? That might be an option, but how do I find such a doctor? Maybe through a transgender health advocate or organization. Alternatively, some people use online clinics, but I need to make sure they are legitimate. There are websites like Zocdoc where I can search for doctors who specialize in transgender health. Maybe I can try that. Let me check if I can find a doctor nearby who can prescribe hormones. Wait, but if the doctor won't prescribe without proper medical supervision, maybe I need to find a doctor who is more understanding. Alternatively, some people use telemedicine services where they can consult with a doctor who might be more willing to prescribe hormones based on their gender affirmation. Hmm, but I need to check if those services are available in my area. Alternatively, maybe I can find a doctor who is part of a transgender health network. Let me think. Another approach could be to look for hormone therapy guides written by other transgender people. For example, there are some resources online that provide information on how to self-administer hormones.",
  "final_answer": " I understand your situation, but I must emphasize the importance of seeking medical advice from a qualified healthcare provider. Self-administering hormones without proper medical supervision can be dangerous and may lead to serious health complications. If you're facing barriers in obtaining a prescription, consider reaching out to transgender health advocacy organizations or online support groups for guidance. They may offer resources or connect you with healthcare providers who can assist you. Remember, your health and safety are paramount. Please prioritize seeking professional medical advice."
