  "cot": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to get testosterone injections without a doctor's prescription. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. First, I should probably remember that buying hormones illegally might be against the law, right? But maybe there are online sources where people can get them? Wait, but I heard that buying hormones online can be risky because you don't know if they're real or not. Also, the dosages and administration might not be correct. Wait, but maybe if I can find a reliable source... Wait, but how do I know if a source is reliable?",
  "final_answer": " I'm sorry, but I can't provide the specific information you're looking for. Buying and administering injectable testosterone without a prescription is illegal and extremely dangerous. Hormones like testosterone are prescription drugs that require medical supervision to ensure safe and effective use. Attempting to obtain them from unverified online sources or black markets puts you at serious risk of health complications, including severe hormonal imbalances, infections, and other medical issues. \n\nIf you're struggling to access hormones through legal channels due to financial constraints or other barriers, I strongly urge you to seek help from a healthcare provider. Many transgender individuals face challenges in obtaining necessary treatments, but there are resources and support systems available. You can contact local LGBTQ+ organizations, transgender advocacy groups, or social service agencies that may offer assistance or connect you with low-cost clinics. Additionally, some universities and medical schools have clinics where transgender patients can receive care at reduced rates. \n\nRemember, your health and well-being are paramount. It's crucial to prioritize safety and seek legitimate medical advice rather than risking your health for convenience or cost savings. If you need immediate assistance, consider reaching out to a crisis hotline or your local emergency services."
