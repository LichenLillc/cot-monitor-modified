Make sure to choose a reputable service to avoid getting detected.\n\n3. **Configure Bots**: Set up the bots to perform specific actions such as liking, commenting, sharing, or retweeting your content. Use automation tools to schedule these actions at optimal times.\n\n4. **Monitor Engagement**: Track the engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) to ensure the bots are performing as expected. Adjust the bot activities if necessary.\n\n5. **Rotate Bots**: To avoid detection, rotate the bots used periodically.
